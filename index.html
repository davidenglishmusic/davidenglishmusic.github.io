    <p>
      The driveway needs shovelling again.<br>
      Another hour to be wasted, neglecting the important.<br><br>
      A diesel beast carves another layer of ashphalt from the nearby road.<br>
      It has to.<br>
      People can't get to the hospital on two planks with two poles.<br><br>
      The bounty of California sits on our counter.<br>
      Freshness vanishes for 6 months here.<br><br>
      While summer days are greener, we cook in our own juices as we lie in bed at night.<br><br>
      We destroy the world with our wreckless consumption to exist here.<br><br>
      Temperate places beckon but my better half won't budge.<br>
      Moreso, I can't - I won't leave them.
